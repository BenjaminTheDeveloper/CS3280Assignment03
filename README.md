# Palindrome Assignment

# Logic in Palindrome.cs
    Written by Benjamin Medrano
    
# Description 
    
    This program was written to check if a given phrase is the same as itself reversed. 
    This assignment was written to use TDD (Test Driven Development).
    Given a set of tests it was required to write the logic that covers all the testing. 

# Variables
    var sb = new StringBuilder; Used to pass the puncuationless version of input into InputWithNoPuncuation
    string inputWithNoPunctuation; Used to remove puncuation that interefers with Palindrome Testing
    char[] punctuation; Contains puncuation that could possibly interefere with Palindrome Testing
    var reversedInput; Used to test if the reversed version of the input matches the original input


# Usage 
       1. Enter a phrase to test to see if it is a palindrome
       2. Continue if you'd like by entering a new phrase
